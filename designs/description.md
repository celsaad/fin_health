1. Onboarding:

- Title: Welcome to Fin Health
- Description: A visually engaging introductory screen with a clean and modern design. It features a concise headline welcoming users to the app and a brief tagline highlighting the app's core benefit (e.g., "Effortlessly manage your finances"). Below, there are 2-3 key features listed with short descriptions and accompanying icons. The screen concludes with clear call-to-action buttons: "Sign Up" for new users and "Log In" for existing users. Subtle animations or interactive elements can be included to enhance user engagement.

2. Dashboard with Financial Health Summary:

- Title: Dashboard
- Mobile Navigation: [Dashboard icon], [Transactions icon], [Add icon], [Reports icon], [Settings icon]
- Description: The central hub of the app, presenting a comprehensive overview of the user's financial status. At the top, display current account balances for linked accounts. A summary of recent transactions (e.g., last 5-10) follows, with clear visual cues for income (e.g., green) and expenses (e.g., red). Include interactive charts, such as a line graph depicting net worth over time or a pie chart illustrating spending by category. Prominently feature a "Financial Health" section with a visual summary icon (e.g., a gauge or progress bar) representing overall financial status. This section should also provide quick access to detailed monthly and yearly reports.

3. Transactions with Note Indicator:

- Title: Transactions
- Mobile Navigation: [Dashboard icon], [Transactions icon], [Add icon], [Reports icon], [Settings icon]
- Description: A detailed list of all financial transactions, displayed chronologically with the most recent transactions at the top. Each transaction entry should clearly show the date, amount, payee/source, and category. A search bar at the top allows users to filter transactions by keywords, amount, or category. Sorting options (e.g., by date or amount) are accessible via a dropdown or icon. Transactions with associated notes are subtly indicated by a small icon (e.g., a note or comment bubble). An export button (e.g., a "Share" or "Download" icon) enables users to export transaction data in CSV or Excel format, with options to select a date range.

4. Add Transaction with Quick Select Buttons:

- Title: Add Transaction
- Mobile Navigation: [Dashboard icon], [Transactions icon], [Add icon], [Reports icon], [Settings icon]
- Description: An interface for manually adding new income or expense transactions. Input fields include amount, date (with a date picker), category and subcategory (with searchable dropdowns), and an optional notes field. To streamline input, implement smart defaults that pre-select frequently used categories based on the user's history. Prominently display quick select buttons for common transaction amounts (e.g., $10, $20, $50, $100) to avoid manual entry. A clear "Save" or "Add" button confirms the transaction entry.

5. Categories:

- Title: Categories
- Mobile Navigation: [Dashboard icon], [Transactions icon], [Add icon], [Reports icon], [Settings icon]
- Description: A screen for managing transaction categories and subcategories. Users can view a list of existing categories, each potentially represented by a unique icon or color. Options to add new categories or edit/delete existing ones should be clearly presented (e.g., a "+" button to add, and edit/delete options accessible via a long-press or swipe action on a category). The interface should intuitively handle the relationship between main categories and their subcategories, possibly using an expandable/collapsible list format.

6. Customizable Financial Metrics in Reports:

- Title: Reports
- Mobile Navigation: [Dashboard icon], [Transactions icon], [Add icon], [Reports icon], [Settings icon]
- Description: A visually rich section summarizing financial data with interactive charts and graphs. It should offer filters for different time periods (e.g., monthly, yearly) and categories. A key feature is a detailed view for overall financial status, including a prominent display of net worth, a breakdown of assets versus liabilities, and a historical trend graph of net worth. Within this view, users can customize the displayed financial metrics (e.g., Net Worth, Debt-to-Income Ratio, Savings Rate, Investment Performance) via a settings or "Customize" option, presenting a checklist or toggle list for metric selection. Clear labels, tooltips, and legends should ensure data is easily understandable.

7. Settings:

- Title: Settings
- Mobile Navigation: [Dashboard icon], [Transactions icon], [Add icon], [Reports icon], [Settings icon]
- Description: A screen for managing app preferences, account details, and accessing support or help resources. The layout should be intuitive, with clearly defined sections for different settings categories such as "Account" (for personal and profile information), "Notifications" (for managing alerts and reminders), "Security" (for privacy and login settings), and "Support" or "Help" (providing access to FAQs, contact forms, or tutorials). Each setting option should be accompanied by a clear label and, where applicable, a concise description or toggle switch. The design should be clean and organized to ensure easy navigation and a user-friendly experience.
